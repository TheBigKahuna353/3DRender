Works by casting rays in the direction the player is looking and using the distance to determine the height of the rectangle to draw on the screen

At the top of the code is a 2D list of 1s and 0s, you can change this to make the map

Did not come up with this myself, followed Coding train do this in java using processing and did it in pygame
